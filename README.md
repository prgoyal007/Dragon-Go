# Dragon_Go

This is my first introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Python before starting university classes and formally learning OOP. I made this game in more than a month by self learning OOP principles along the way. 

It is a text-based user interactive game using common themes from Dungeons & Dragnons and Pokemon.
