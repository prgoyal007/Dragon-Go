Now let's begin our adventure! Sensei Roku has offered you to explore the Kingdom of Vrubel.

The Kingdom of Vrubel was once a thriving region which flourished for over a 1000 years. It was home to over million of 
humans and billions of dragons. However, the kingdom collapsed as corruption and chaos flooded the lands.

Present day, 300 years later, the region is dangerously over run by dragons. Humans now explore the land to train and 
compete with their dragons.
